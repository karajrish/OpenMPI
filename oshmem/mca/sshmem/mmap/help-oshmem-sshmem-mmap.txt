[mmap segment failed]
The OpenSHMEM "mmap" plugin in the "sshmem" framework failed to
allocate a shared memory segement via the mmap system call.  This
usually means that there are not enough resources available to your
memory subsystem on your server. 

Your OpenSHMEM job will now abort.

   Server:         %s
   Requested mmap
     segment size: %u
   Specific error: %s (%d)

You can try to decrease the symmetric heap area with:

"-x SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE=<value>".
