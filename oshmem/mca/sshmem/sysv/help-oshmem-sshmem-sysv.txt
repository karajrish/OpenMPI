[create segment failure]
The OpenSHMEM "sysv" plugin in the "sshmem" framework failed to
allocate a shared memory segment via the shmat(2) system call.  This
usually means that there are not enough resources available to the
SYSV shared memory subsystem on your server.

Your OpenSHMEM job will now abort.

   Server:                %s
   Requested shared 
     memory segment size: %u
   Specific error:        %s (%d)

You can try the following:

1. Use a different sshmem plugin (e.g., "mmap") with "--mca sshmem mmap".
2. Decrease the symmetric heap area size with "-x
   SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE=<value>".
3. Increase your system's allowable SYSV shared memory segment size
   (e.g., via the SHMMAX and/or SMMAX kernel parameters).
